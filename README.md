# 8Game-A-Search

To play the game, open the HTML file in a browser. The game board will appear on the screen, randomly shuffled. Use the arrow keys to move the empty tile and rearrange the tiles. The goal is to get the tiles in order, with the empty tile in the lower-right corner.

You can use the " " key to search for a solution to the puzzle using the "board.search()" function that uses Breadth-first search algorithm, and the "s" key to search for a solution using the "board.prioritySearch()" function that uses A\* search algorithm. The number of nodes visited will be displayed on the screen.

You can also use the "demo" function to watch the solution being played out, with a delay between each move.

### Controlls

*   Use arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) to move the empty tile
*   Press " " to find the solution using breadth-first search algorithm
*   Press "s" to find the solution using A\* search algorithm

### Debugging

The "console.log" statements in the code can be used to debug the program and check the output of the various functions being called.
